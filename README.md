2. **View Expenses**: All expenses are listed with their amounts. The total is calculated in real time.
3. **Delete Expense**: Click the "Delete" button next to any expense to remove it from the list and local storage.
4. **Persistence**: All data remains even after refreshing or closing the browser, thanks to localStorage.
